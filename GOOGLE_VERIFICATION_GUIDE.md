This guide will help you resolve the Google verification issues for your IntegratePDF application.

## Issues to Resolve

1. **Homepage requirements** ✅ (Already fixed)

## Step 1: Domain Ownership Verification

### Option A: HTML File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Get your verification file from Google Search Console:**
   - Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
   - Add your property (https://yourdomain.com)
   - Choose "HTML file upload" verification method
   - Download the verification file (e.g., `google1234567890abcdef.html`)

2. **Upload the file to your website:**
   - Replace the placeholder file `public/google-site-verification.html` with your actual verification file
   - The file should be accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/google1234567890abcdef.html`

3. **Verify in Google Search Console:**
   - Click "Verify" in Google Search Console
   - Wait for confirmation

### Option B: HTML Meta Tag

1. **Get your meta tag from Google Search Console:**
   - Choose "HTML tag" verification method
   - Copy the meta tag (e.g., `<meta name="google-site-verification" content="abc123..." />`)

2. **Add to your environment variables:**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=abc123...
   ```

3. **Deploy your changes and verify**

## Step 2: Homepage Requirements ✅

Your homepage already meets Google's requirements:

- ✅ **Accurately represents your app** - Clear description of PDF data extraction
- ✅ **Describes functionality** - Explains AI-powered PDF processing and integrations
- ✅ **Explains data usage** - Transparent about processing and integration purposes
- ✅ **Hosted on verified domain** - Will be verified in Step 1
- ✅ **Privacy policy link** - Available in footer
- ✅ **Publicly accessible** - No login required

## Step 3: Privacy Policy Requirements ✅

Your privacy policy already meets requirements:

- ✅ **Comprehensive data collection info**
- ✅ **Clear usage explanations**
- ✅ **Security measures described**
- ✅ **User rights outlined**
- ✅ **Contact information provided**

## Step 4: OAuth Consent Screen (if applicable)

If you're using Google OAuth for integrations:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console:**
   - Navigate to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen
   - Update homepage URL to your verified domain

2. **Ensure all fields are filled:**

   - User support email: integratepdf@gmail.com
   - Homepage URL: https://yourdomain.com
   - Privacy policy URL: https://yourdomain.com/privacy

   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Files to upload:**
   - Your Google verification HTML file in `/public/`
   - Updated environment variables

3. **Test accessibility:**
   - Visit your homepage without logging in
   - Verify privacy policy link works
   - Check verification file is accessible

## Step 6: Verification Process

1. **Deploy your changes**
2. **Wait 24-48 hours** for DNS propagation
3. **Verify in Google Search Console**
4. **Resubmit for OAuth verification** if applicable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Verification file not found:**
   - Ensure file is in `/public/` directory
   - Check file name matches exactly
   - Verify file is accessible via browser

2. **Meta tag not found:**
   - Check environment variable is set
   - Verify deployment includes the variable
   - View page source to confirm tag presence

3. **Homepage not accessible:**

   - Check for redirects

### Testing Commands:
